# Tiny RTOS on POSIX

This is a starter project scaffold for building a **tiny RTOS simulation** in user-space C on POSIX systems.

### Project Goals
- Implement a **preemptive scheduler** (priority or MLFQ).
- Provide a **device model** for UART, SPI, and timers.
- Simulate a **DMA engine** for buffer transfers.
- Add a **command-line interface (CLI)** to interact with tasks.

This repository contains only an empty structure (headers, sources, tests).  
You should fill in implementations and expand the README with your design choices.
